They exhibit a rough symmetry; they rarely attain any size; and they

of cartilage into bone being then completed. While they originate from

increases in length, to project from the surface of the bone at some
distance from the ossifying junction and to \"point\" away from it. They

motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes, and the
expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much,
and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated
herself on arriving. She was planning something and either deciding or
had already decided something in her mind. The countess knew this, but
what it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and tormented her.</item>_ClinicallyWhen Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was
